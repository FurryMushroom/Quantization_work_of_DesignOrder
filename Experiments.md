And because Olive has really inspiring experiental results, we tried to reproduce the accuracy results on missions requiring less computational resources. And because hardware doesn't support the FP-based formats, it's predictable there won't be real savings on memory or decrease on inference time. We only conduct the INT4 experiments.
